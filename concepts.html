<p>In this chapter, we explore some of the key marketing concepts that you may find helpful in analyzing the client’s business problems. In marketing courses, client’s business problem will relate to its marketing issues. Therefore, invariably so, you need to understand the market and its key players to explore the assigned business problems appropriately.</p>
<p>A market is a private economic structure that facilitates production and exchange in the economy. There are three types of primary markets: 1) the <code>labor market</code> (market for workers), 2) the <code>capital or finance market</code> (market for loans, stocks, and bonds), and 3) the <code>market for goods and services</code>. In marketing, we deal with the third kind of market, which we will call the marketing environment.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-mktplayers">Figure&nbsp;<span>10.1</span></a> captures a general marketing environment and its key players.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>A company in a marketing environment is involved in production of goods and services. Sometimes it is also referred to as a firm or a producer or an organization or a startup or an entrepreneur. Whenever we talk about a company in a marketing environment, our implicit assumption will be <code>for-profit</code> company whose main objective is to maximize profit.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits</em>.<br>
– Milton Friedman (1970)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Profit is the amount left after paying business expenses.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost}.
\]</span> Cost has two components: variable and fixed. Thus,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\text{ Profit } = &amp; \text{ Revenue } - \text{ (Variable Cost + Fixed Cost) } .\\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Revenue and variable cost depend on unit price, unit cost, and quantity. Let <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> denote the profit, then,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\pi = &amp; (p \times Q) - (c \times Q + FC) .\\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The quantity produced by the company depends on two factors: <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, market size (expressed in number)<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, market share (expressed in percentage). Thus, the above formula can be written down as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\pi = &amp; (p \times M \times S) - (c \times M \times S  + FC) .\\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The breakdown of profit in this manner gives you a general idea about what firms should do to optimize their profits. The general rule of thumb is to increase revenue and decrease cost, which can be achieved through distinct marketing strategies depending on the firm’s objectives and constraints.</p>
<p>Customers are another key player in a marketing environment. They are also called consumers, users, households, individuals, groups, and humans. In a marketing environment, marketers are mainly interested in understanding consumer behavior, which studies the processes involved when consumers select, purchase, use or dispose of products, services, ideas, or experiences to satisfy needs<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and desires.</p>
<p>There are several theoretical lenses to study consumer behavior. Each of these theoretical lenses explores how consumers make decisions. The concept of <code>economic man</code> considers consumers as entirely rational and self-interested, making decisions based on the ability to maximize utility while expending minimum effort. <code>Psychodynamic</code> approach posits that consumer behavior is subject to biological influence via ‘instinctive forces’ or ‘drive’ which act outside of conscious thoughts. <code>Behavioral approach</code> states that consumers’ behavior is explained by external events. <code>Cognitive</code> approach treats consumers as information processor and attributes their behavior to intrapersonal cognition. <code>Humanistic</code> approach attempts to explain consumer behavior through constructs such as emotion, volition, and egoism.</p>
<p>In our courses, students will be advised to study consumer behavior from economic or cognitive approaches. Both of these theories consider consumers as rational decision-makers meaning consumers acting out of self-interest select the option that will bring them the most utility (or satisfaction).</p>
<p>Multi-attribute modeling is widely used in marketing to understand the process of consumers’ decision making that helps firms in evaluating and/or designing their offerings for greater customer satisfaction and profitability. The model has two parts. First, it considers a product as a bundle of attributes. Second, a consumer’s overall attitude towards the product is derived from his belief and feelings about the various attributes of the product. The model is expressed as follows. For consumer, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, her overall attitude, <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> towards a product, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, containing <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> attributes is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
U_{cp} = \sum_{i=1}^{N}B_{ci}A_{pi},
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(B_{ci}\)</span> is the importance of attribute <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> for consumer <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(A_{pi}\)</span> is the strength or rating of attribute <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> possessed by product <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now that we have understood the nature of two critical players in any marketing environment, it is essential to know that marketing problems revolve around understanding the interaction between the two. The interaction between firms and consumers is called <code>exchange,</code> where value is transferred between the two parties. In most scenarios, we will be interested in <code>transaction</code> where firms deliver goods and services to consumers in return for money. In simple terms, transaction involves selling and buying.</p>
<p>We will make an important assumption that exchange takes place in a <code>free market</code>. In a free market, exchange is undertaken between the two parties voluntarily.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>Free markets make free men</em>.<br>
– Milton Friedman (1974)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having understood the marketing environment, its key players, and the interaction between them, it’s time to link them with industry projects. Clients involved in industry project are companies, one of the key players in the marketing environment. Therefore, you have to put yourself into their shoes, and think about their business problems. In other words, you will tackle the assigned business problems from the firm’s perspective. In this regard, these problems may revolve around these three broad concepts.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Understanding clients’ customer</strong>: Most marketing problems will invariably include understanding of your client’s customers needs and wants. To that end, some key questions that may arise are as follows.
<ul>
<li>How do customers make decision?</li>
<li>Do customers show brand attachment?</li>
<li>Are customers loyal to the client’s brands?</li>
<li>Do customers identify their personality through the brand?</li>
<li>How do customers are involved in value co-creation?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Differentiating client’s offering</strong>: In a free market, there is competition. Therefore, your client may be faced with differentiating its products from its competitors’ offering. At the heart of product differentiation lies answer to this critical questions: what is the value proposition? To that end, some of the key problems that you may deal with are as follow.
<ul>
<li>Segmentation</li>
<li>Targeting</li>
<li>Positioning via marketing mix</li>
<li>New product development</li>
<li>Innovation</li>
<li>Customer relationship</li>
<li>Advertising</li>
<li>Channel management</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Maximizing client’s profit</strong>: For for-profit firms, maximizing profit is the main business goal. This goal helps them to meet expectations of their stakeholders. To that end, you may be dealing with the following client’s problems.
<ul>
<li>Market orientation: Priority on the profitable creation and maintenance of superior customer value while considering the interests of other key stakeholders. It involves customer orientation, competitive orientation, and functional coordination.</li>
<li>Marketing concept: Focus on long-term profitability with coordinated activities towards satisfying the needs of a particular market segment(s).</li>
<li>Sustainable marketing strategy: Influencing consumers’ purchase decisions not just by functional and emotional criteria, but also by carefully considering socio-ecological factors.</li>
<li>Marketing strategy: Optimal planning of controllable factors to optimize firm’s bottom line.</li>
<li>Dynamic markets: Flexibility in marketing strategy with changing marketing environment.</li>
<li>Competitive advantage: Showing better value proposition of your client’s offerings.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Now you have a general idea about broader marketing problems that your client may assign in industry project. Next step is to think about the strategies or solutions. In the following subsections, some of the important marketing concepts are outlined that may help you think about your solutions conceptually.</p>
<section id="marketing-mix-modeling" class="level2" data-number="10.1">
<h2 data-number="10.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="marketing-mix-modeling"><span class="header-section-number">10.1</span> Marketing Mix Modeling</h2>
<p>Marketing mix models are models that contain more than one marketing decision variables.</p>
<p>In response model, these variables contain a subset of marketing mix (i.e., <code>product</code>, <code>price</code>, <code>place</code>, and <code>promotion</code>) that determine brand performance (e.g, sales, market share, profitability). These marketing mix elements are important as they are controlled by the firm.</p>
<p>In decision model, marketers are also interested in coordination between the marketing-mix elements. For example, focal brand’s performance could be influenced by the competitors’ marketing decision variables.</p>
<p>A general form of market-response model can be expressed as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
y = f(X,Z;\; \beta, \theta;\; \epsilon),
\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>: a market performance measures (e.g., sales)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>: a set of marketing mix variables influencing possibly <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>: a set of environmental variables that the firm can not control.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>: the response parameters of the marketing mix variables.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>: the response parameters of the environmental variables.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>: a disturbance term.</li>
</ul>
<p>Marketing mix modeling can help you understanding attribution, forecasting, optimization, allocation, and ROI calculation.</p>

<h2 data-number="10.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="consumer-behavior"><span class="header-section-number">10.2</span> Consumer Behavior</h2>
<p>Consumer behavior refers to the study of how consumers make decisions relating to the following contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li>to satisfy their needs, wants, and desires</li>
<li>to make choice</li>
<li>to have preference</li>
<li>to purchase/buy</li>
<li>to use and dispose products</li>
</ul>
<p>In <a href="#fig-consumerdecision">Figure&nbsp;<span>10.2</span></a>, a simplified framework of consumers’ decision making process is illustrated.</p>

<p>One of the oldest model to understand sales strategy based on consumer behavior was developed in 1898 by Elmo Lewis, an advertising strategist, called AIDA. It stands for <code>awareness</code>, <code>interest</code>, <code>desire</code>, and <code>action</code>. AIDA model has been used to define marketing funnel to understand customers’ buying stages as shown in <a href="#fig-aidamodel">Figure&nbsp;<span>10.3</span></a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Consumer behavior has become increasingly complex with the increasing impact of digital technologies in the marketplace. Hence, especially in a digital marketing environment, marketers are interested in the consumer purchase journey that captures a process that consumers go through, across all stages and touchpoints that make up the consumer experience. Consumer experience is a multidimensional construct that involves cognitive, emotional, behavioral, sensorial, and social components. Accordingly, marketers instead of marketing funnel use consumer purchase map to understand consumer purchase journey to enhance consumer experience at each and every stage via multiple touchpoints. A consumer purchase map consists of details of decision paths and key interactions customers encounter with a brand as they move through the complex purchase process. <a href="#fig-ikeamap">Figure&nbsp;<span>10.4</span></a> shows customer journey map for Ikea. A well crafted customer journey map provides a gateway into customers’ minds, helping brands to understand and address customers’ pain points thereby providing them with superior customer experience.</p>

<p><code>Customer heterogeneity</code> is an important concept in consumer behavior. It means <code>all customers differ</code>. Customer heterogeneity captures the variation among customers in terms of their needs, wants, responses, and behaviors. marketers use individual differences, life experiences, functional needs, self-identity, and marketing activities to explain customer heterogeneity. The core objective of a quintessential marketing strategy of segmentation, positioning and targeting (STP) is to address customer heterogeneity. <a href="#fig-stp">Figure&nbsp;<span>10.5</span></a> illustrates this concept.</p>

<p><a href="#fig-mktera">Figure&nbsp;<span>10.6</span></a> shows the evolution of marketing. The focus of current marketing strategies is on customers and building relationship with them. In 2004, American Marketing Association followed the following definition of marketing that emphasized on relationship building.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Marketing is an organizational function and a set of processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for <code>managing customer relationships</code> in ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firms create value by focusing their strategies on two dimensions: transactional and relational. Long-lasting firm value is an outcome of relational marketing.</p>
<p>Relationship marketing is the process of <code>identifying</code>, <code>developing</code>, <code>maintaining</code>, and <code>terminating</code> relational exchanges with the purpose of enhancing performance.</p>
<p>The objective of relationship marketing is to optimize customer lifetime value (LTV) rather than per customer transaction. Customer LTV can be captured either using past customer value or future customer value.</p>
<p>For a customer <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, if we know her gross contribution margin, <span class="math inline">\(GC\)</span>, for all the past time periods, <span class="math inline">\(t = \{1,...,T\}\)</span>, then the past customer value, <span class="math inline">\(PTV\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
PTV = \sum_{t=1}^{T}GC_{it} \times (1+r)^t,
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the interest rate.</p>
<p>However, firms are often interested in the future value of their customers. Note that the value that will be received in future is discounted at current time period due to uncertainty and consumer psychology. Let’s assume <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is the discount rate. Therefore, for a customer <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, if we assume her future gross contribution margin, <span class="math inline">\(GC\)</span>, for all the future time periods, <span class="math inline">\(t = \{1,...,T\}\)</span>, then the future customer value or simply the customer life time value, <span class="math inline">\(LTV\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
LTV = \sum_{t=1}^{T}GC_{it} \times \left(\frac{1}{1+\delta}\right)^t
\]</span> Next, note that firms are not sure about the future contributions from consumers. It depends on what is the retention rate, <span class="math inline">\(Rr\)</span>. Let’s assume that retention rate remains constant over time. Then, factoring in this information, the life time value becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
LTV = \sum_{t=1}^{T}GC_{it} \times \left(\frac{Rr}{1+\delta}\right)^t
\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s assume <span class="math inline">\(CAC\)</span> is the customer acquisition cost.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Factoring in this information, the life time value becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
LTV = \left(\sum_{t=1}^{T}GC_{it} \times \left(\frac{Rr}{1+\delta}\right)^t\right) - CAC
\]</span> If contribution margin is constant over time, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(GC_{it} = GC_{i} \text{  } \forall \text{ } t\in\{1,...,T\}\)</span> then we can simplify the above equation over the infinite time horizon, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(T=\infty\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s assume the first term is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> such that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    S &amp;= \sum_{t=1}^{\infty}{GC_{i} \left(\frac{Rr}{1+\delta}\right)^t}\\
      &amp;= \sum_{t=1}^{\infty}{GC_{i} (a)^t}\\
    \end{split}
    \nonumber
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    a=\frac{Rr}{1+\delta}
    \nonumber
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>Now expanding the sum <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    S=GC_{i}(a)^1+GC_{i}(a)^2+GC_{i}(a)^3+....\infty
    \nonumber
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>Multiplying both sides of this equation with <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    aS=GC_{i}(a)^2+GC_{i}(a)^3+GC_{i}(a)^4+....\infty
    \nonumber
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>Subtracting <span class="math inline">\(aS\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    S-aS= &amp; GC_{i}(a)^1+GC_{i}(a)^2+GC_{i}(a)^3+....\infty\\
          &amp; \qquad \qquad -GC_{i}(a)^2-GC_{i}(a)^3-....\infty\
    \end{split}
    \nonumber
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    S-aS= GC_{i}(a)
    \nonumber
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>We get sum <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    S= \frac{GC_{i}(a)}{1-a}
    \nonumber
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>The term <span class="math inline">\(1-a\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    1-a &amp;= 1-\frac{Rr}{1+\delta}\\
        &amp;= \frac{1+\delta-Rr}{1+\delta}
    \end{split}
    \nonumber
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1-a\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    S &amp;= \frac{GC_{i}(a)}{1-a}\\
      &amp;= GC_{i} \times \frac{Rr}{1+\delta} \times \frac{1+\delta}{1+\delta-Rr}\\
      &amp;= GC_{i}\left(\frac{Rr}{1+\delta-Rr}\right)
    \end{split}
    \nonumber
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, the life time value <span class="math inline">\(LTV_{i}\)</span> of customer <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    LTV_{i}=GC_{i}\left(\frac{Rr}{1+\delta-Rr}\right) - CAC
    \nonumber
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus we see that CLV is simply the consumer <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’s gross margin, <span class="math inline">\(GC_{i}\)</span> times a margin multiplier <span class="math inline">\(\left(\frac{Rr}{1+\delta-Rr}\right)\)</span>.</p>

<p>Marketing strategies have evolved from being product-centric to customer-centric. Customer centricity is about understanding how not all customers are created equal, and aligning marketing resources to meet the needs and wants of most profitable segments. It is about value-addition rather than value-extraction.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The opportunities to use customer analysis to change behavior go way, way beyond what is in the marketing domain — it goes to how we think about profitability, how we align channels, how we align the service propositions, how we align the operational experience, and how we understand which elements of products or categories are good for acquiring and retaining customers.</p>

<p>Customer centricity is based on the notion that the best customers, the ones you should focus on, is the ones with the highest customer lifetime value. Thus, the focus is on value per acquisition instead of cost per acquisition.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For most companies, it is a gross error to develop a marketing program aimed at the “average customer.” Today such a consumer, or such a company, hardly exists. In short, the company that is not alert to the customers’ needs and the changing complexities of marketplaces is inviting disaster.</p>

<p>Digital marketing explores the changing nature of traditional areas of marketing (such as product, pricing, promotion, and place) due to major impact of <code>digital technologies</code> (internet, digital computing tools, hardware, software), <code>online networks</code> (social media for communication and connection, digital platforms for distribution), <code>information</code> (information goods, quality of signal), and <code>attention</code> (plethora of information cause scarcity of attention).</p>
<p>How digital technologies have changed marketing landscape?</p>
<ul>
<li>Lowered search costs for customers.</li>
<li>Lowered marginal cost of digital goods (anything that can be represented as bits and bytes are called digital goods), i.e., certain digital goods can be replicated at no costs.</li>
<li>Lowered transportation cost of digital goods.</li>
<li>Lead to the proliferation of individual-level data, enabling the marketer to do personalization and targeting at a much more granular level.</li>
<li>Lowered cost of firms’ reputation.</li>
<li>Enabled proliferation of social networks at a massive scale.</li>
<li>Lead to explosion of information.</li>
<li>Created scarcity of attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>These major impacts of digital technologies have changed marketing fundamentally. These impacts are felt at both sides: firm and consumers. Digital technologies have empowered customers. Therefore, for brands to succeed in digital marketing environment, it is essential for them to drive brand-related conversations in consumer-space rather than in brand-space. Furthermore, brands need to constantly improve and refine their digital marketing strategies to build affect both transactional and relational dimensions of the customer-firm relationship.</p>
<p>In today’s technology driven marketplace, a strong digital marketing strategy could become a question of survival for many firms. In industry projects, you may be dealing with the following types of clients’ digital marketing strategy: social media marketing, multichannel marketing, search engine marketing, search engine optimization, email marketing, online advertising, content marketing, website marketing, mobile marketing, marketing platforms, online brand community.</p>

<p>Data-driven marketing is carried out using market research and marketing analytics. Market research helps marketers to understand the market, i.e., customers’ needs and wants, which subsequently feeds into critical marketing operations: segmentation, targeting, and positioning.</p>
<p>But, when you think of 42% of startups failing due to not meeting market needs, you question the efficacy of market research. That’s when you realize the importance of marketing analytics. Market research will provide you with metrics that primarily serve as lagging indicators, whereas metrics coming from marketing analytics are often leading indicators.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Marketing analytics involves collection, management, and analysis — descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive and cognitive — of data to obtain insights into marketing performance, maximize the effectiveness of instruments of marketing control, and optimize firms’ return on investment (ROI).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marketing analytics helps in capturing all the relevant market data to be integrated, analyzed, and interpreted to evaluate all options for growth. It helps in modeling and capturing interdependence in marketing mix (product, price, place, and promotion), enabling firms to consider multiple options and their associated risks. To that end, marketing analytics helps firm in achieving three goals: attribution (the process of quantifying the contribution of each element of marketing mix), optimization (run business scenarios using predictive modeling to assess efficacy of different marketing mix strategies), and allocation (real-time redistribution of limited resources across marketing activities based on optimization).</p>
<p>Thus, marketing analytics leads to action and tells you the reason why, ultimately helping firms to grow revenue, charge higher prices, and win against the competition.</p>

Once you got halfway to your destination, you had to decide whether to turn back or to abandon the lines and go on. Once you made the decision to move forward, you were all in. You won big or lost big.</p>
<p>Blitzscaling involves both offensive and defensive marketing strategies. For online businesses, where margins are low, volume matters. Therefore, they employ all sorts of marketing strategies to scale it up quickly. Businesses can scale along three dimensions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grow revenue</li>
<li>Grow customer base</li>
<li>Grow organization</li>
</ul>
<p>Strategies for blitzscaling requires freedom from normal business rules. <a href="#fig-fb_blitzscale">Figure&nbsp;<span>10.13</span></a> show the growth in Facebook as a results of bltizscaling.</p>

<h3 data-number="10.8.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="minimum-viable-product"><span class="header-section-number">10.8.3</span> Minimum viable product</h3>
<p>A primary reason of startup failure is <code>"no market need."</code> To avoid such a trap, startups often comes up with a minimum viable product (MVP), which is a proof of concept of their ideas.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>An MVP is the version of a new product that allows the team to gather the maximum amount of proven customer knowledge with the least amount of effort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, MVP doesn’t have to be a product. You could consider it as a repeated process to identify the <code>riskiest assumptio</code>n, find the <code>smallest possible experiment</code> to test that assumption, and use the result of the experiment to improve the idea. Entrepreneurs often make the following risky assumptions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What consumers are looking for</li>
<li>How the design should work</li>
<li>What marketing strategy to use</li>
<li>What architecture will work most efficiently</li>
<li>Which monetization strategy will make it sustainable</li>
<li>Which laws and regulations have to complied with</li>
</ul>
<p>MVP allows startups to test these assumptions by putting their products in front of real users as quickly as possible.</p>
