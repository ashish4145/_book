    "text": "Preface\nAt RMIT, we pride in providing hands-on learning experience in collaboration with industry. Industry engagement in research, education, and social impact makes RMIT a truly applied university.\n\nInternationally recognised as a leader in applied research and education, RMIT has a strong reputation working alongside businesses to deliver innovative solutions and create impact.\n\nThe business landscape is constantly changing. RMIT collaborates locally and globally with business, government, the not-for-profit sector and the community through partnerships that address current and future business challenges.\nAs a student, you experience such industry partnerships in your courses in various forms. For example, courses invite industry speakers to demonstrate how fundamental concepts, theories, and pedagogical skills are applied in business environment. Assessments in the courses, such as course projects, are designed in collaboration with industry partners. Case studies used in the courses are specifically designed by the instructors in a local context by collaborating with industry partners.\nThis book is prepared to guide students who are working on course projects in collaboration with industry partners. These course projects are comprehensive part of course assessment as they account for a major chunk of the course grade, they consist of continuous evaluation where project progress is measured throughout the semester (e.g., project introduction, engaging with industry partners, feedback session, and collaboration), they consist of multiple submissions (e.g, report and presentation), and students often work in groups to complete them. Thus, students face several challenges in managing course projects throughout the semester. The book addresses some of these challenges to ensure students complete their course project successfully.\n\n\n\n\nAdobe. 2022. “ROI in Digital Marketing — What It Looks Like, How to Calculate It, and How to Maximize It.” https://business.adobe.com/blog/basics/understanding-roi-in-digital-marketing.\n\n\nAPA. 2022. “Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, Seventh Edition (2020).” https://apastyle.apa.org/products/publication-manual-7th-edition?tab=3.\n\n\nBerkman, Jim. 2022. “A Minimum Viable Product Is Not a Product, It’s a Process.” Y Combinator. https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4Q-a-minimum-viable-product-is-not-a-product-it-s-a-process.\n\n\nFader, Peter. 2020.

    "text": "1.1 Objective of Industry Project\nThe objective of industry project is to provide students with hands-on learning experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHands-on Learning\n\n\n\n\nStudents usually works in groups.\nStudents interact with peers (e.g., group members, clients, instructors) to solve business problems.\nStudents ask questions based on observations and interactions.\nStudents collect data and provide solutions to real business problems.\n\n\n\nAn industry project is an activity-based assessment task that is authentic. In a pedagogical learning environment such as a university, students often are puzzled by how to apply the theories, concepts, methods, and skills learning in the classroom environment to solve business problems or to explain natural phenomena. Industry project that forms one significant part of the course assessments attempts to address this concern.\nLearning outcomes of an industry project are three folds.\n\nFirst, a real business problem faced by an industry partner (or client) is assigned. Students attempt to arrive at possible solutions via peer interactions. Such peer interactions involve working in groups, talking to the client and its customers, and seeking clarifications from the course instructor.\nSecond, students apply their learning from courses to explain the fit of solutions to the client’s business problem. To that end, they critically analyze the feasibility of theories, concepts, methods, and skills in optimally solving the business problem.\nThird, through peer interactions and the application of course learning, students develop a complete understanding of the problem and make meaning of their learning experience individually. Students exhibit such understanding and meaning via course deliverables such as reports, presentations, peer evaluations, and feedback."

    "text": "1.2 Who are Industry Partners\nIndustry partners are firms/companies/organizations/startups that form an integral part of an academia-industry relationship. Based on course structure, such an academic-industry partnership may involve public policymakers (such as government organizations). Sometimes we will refer to industry partners as simply clients.\nIn designing a problem for an industry project in a course, instructor starts the process way before the semester begins. Instructor gets in touch with possible clients, and explores the business problems faced by them. At the same time, instructor critically assesses the fit of the course contents with the business problems. This process is arduous and there is a lot of back and forth communication between the client and the instructor before the latter finalizes the client for industry project.\nThe relationship between a client and academia is that of a mutual respect and benefit. Clients are investing their valuable time, resources, and knowledge with us. Therefore, we must be respectful to them and give due diligence in solving the assigned business problem. At the same time, clients are getting valuable insights into their business operations from innovative and out of the box solutions provided by students."

    "text": "4.3 Individual Grade Penalty\nIndividual grade penalty will be applied to those students whose contribution to the group is not optimal. The peer evaluation survey will infer individual students’ contribution to the group.\n\nIf you do not complete the peer evaluation survey, you will receive the lowest rating while your rating for other team members will be recorded as maximum rating.\n\nCompleting the peer evaluation survey is mandatory. Failure to do so shows disrespect for other team members. In the peer evaluation survey, including yourself, you rate group members’ contributions to the project.\nThe following algorithm will be used to check condition for individual grade penalty. Let’s assume in a project group \\(G\\) there are \\(n\\) members, i.e., \\(G = \\{1,..., n\\}\\). Then, the following matrix, \\(R_G\\) captures the group members’ contribution via peer evaluation survey for the group \\(G\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nR_G =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nr_{1,1} & r_{1,2} & \\cdots & r_{1,n} \\\\\nr_{2,1} & r_{2,2} & \\cdots & r_{2,n} \\\\\n\\vdots  & \\vdots  & \\ddots & \\vdots  \\\\\nr_{n,1} & r_{n,2} & \\cdots & r_{n,n}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\nwhere \\(r_{i,j}\\) indicates member \\(i\\)’s rating for member \\(j\\).\nSubsequently, we capture average contribution of each member of group \\(G\\) as \\(A_G = \\{a_1, a_2, \\cdots a_n\\}\\), where \\(a_k = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} r_{i,k}\\), which is column average of matrix \\(R_G\\) for column \\(k\\).\nLet \\(\\mu_G\\) and \\(\\sigma_G\\) be the mean and standard deviation of \\(A_G\\), respectively. Then, we define individual member’s contribution deviation from the group mean as \\(D_G = \\{d_1, d_2, \\cdots, d_n\\}\\), where \\(d_k = a_k - \\mu_G\\) for each \\(k \\in (1,n)\\).\nThen, we apply the follow condition for grade penalty.\n\nIf \\(d_k \\geq 0\\), then, no penalty is applied.\nIf \\(d_k < 0\\), then\n\nIf \\(|d_k| > \\sigma_G\\), then grade penalty is considered.\nIf \\(|d_k| \\leq \\sigma_G\\), then grade penalty is not considered.\n\n\nIn other words, grade penalty is considered for those students whose individual average contribution is more than one standard deviation below the group’s mean contribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf penalty criterion based on the above algorithm is met, instructor uses subjective measure to penalize that individual group member. First, she will use the qualitative feedback from the peer evaluation. She may also contact other group members for more information. She may talk to the client to assess the individual member’s activities in the project. Instructor will not share any of these details of the penalized group member.\nHere are some of the examples of individual grade penalty consideration based on group of five students.\nCase-1: No penalty considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.4:  No Penalty for any of the Group Member \n  \n  \n    \n      Member\n      M-1\n      M-2\n      M-3\n      M-4\n      M-5\n    \n  \n  \n    M-1\n4\n3\n2\n5\n5\n    M-2\n3\n3\n4\n4\n4\n    M-3\n2\n3\n4\n5\n5\n    M-4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n    M-5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n    Member Average\n3.60\n3.60\n3.80\n4.60\n4.60\n    Group Average\n4.04\n\n\n\n\n    Group SD\n0.52\n\n\n\n\n    Contribution Deviation\n−0.44\n−0.44\n−0.24\n0.56\n0.56\n    Individual Grade Penalty\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n  \n  \n  \n    \n       Individual Grade Penalty 1 (0) implies penalty is (is not) considered.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nCase-2: Penalty considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.5:  Penalty Considered for one of the Group Members \n  \n  \n    \n      Member\n      M-1\n      M-2\n      M-3\n      M-4\n      M-5\n    \n  \n  \n    M-1\n4\n3\n1\n5\n5\n    M-2\n3\n3\n1\n4\n4\n    M-3\n2\n3\n5\n5\n5\n    M-4\n4\n4\n1\n4\n4\n    M-5\n5\n5\n1\n5\n5\n    Member Average\n3.60\n3.60\n1.80\n4.60\n4.60\n    Group Average\n3.64\n\n\n\n\n    Group SD\n1.14\n\n\n\n\n    Contribution Deviation\n−0.04\n−0.04\n−1.84\n0.96\n0.96\n    Individual Grade Penalty\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n  \n  \n  \n    \n       Individual Grade Penalty 1 (0) implies penalty is (is not) considered.\n    \n    \n       Individual grade penalty is considered for Member 3.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nCase-3: Penalty considered (a consequence of not completing peer evaluation survey).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.6:  Penalty Considered due to not completing Peer Evaluation Survey \n  \n  \n    \n      Member\n      M-1\n      M-2\n      M-3\n      M-4\n      M-5\n    \n  \n  \n    M-1\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n    M-2\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n    M-3\n5\n5\n1\n5\n5\n    M-4\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n    M-5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n    Member Average\n5.00\n5.00\n4.20\n5.00\n5.00\n    Group Average\n4.84\n\n\n\n\n    Group SD\n0.36\n\n\n\n\n    Contribution Deviation\n0.16\n0.16\n−0.64\n0.16\n0.16\n    Individual Grade Penalty\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n  \n  \n  \n    \n       Individual Grade Penalty 1 (0) implies penalty is (is not) considered.\n    \n    \n       Individual grade penalty is considered for Member 3.\n    \n    \n       Member 3 did not fill in peer evaluation survey.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nRemember this “There ain’t no such thing as free lunch.” Therefore, students are advised to be active in the project from day one."

    "text": "5.1 Group Formation\nAn industry project is a group-based task. Thus, the very first requirement to get started with the project is to form a group. A typical project group will consist of 4-6 members. However, group size may vary depending on the class size and the project’s scope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttend the first class\n\n\n\nIn the first class, instructions will be provided about group formation.\n\n\n\n5.1.1 Voluntary group\nIn most of the courses, instructors will allow students to form groups for industry projects. In the first week of the course, during the project briefing, instructor will ask students to form groups for which they will get a week’s time. Students can use either learning management systems (e.g., Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle) or send email or submit a paper to the instructor with a list of student details to form groups.\nStudents should take this step seriously. Instructor will often ask students to introduce themselves in the first class as a part of the meet-and-greet session. Students should carefully listen to how their fellow students describe themselves. Such an introductory session helps you get to know your class fellows. Subsequently, they should talk to their fellow students. It is advised that students should form a cohesive group after talking and getting to know their potential group members.\nDon’t worry if you are unable to form a group. Instructor will help you out before the industry presentation.\n\nIf a student is unable to form a group, instructor will allocate her randomly to any of the project groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Group Swapping\n\n\n\nStudents will not be allowed to swap groups once they are finalized.\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Random group\nThe instructor may not allow students to form groups in some industry projects. The instructor will randomly pre-allocate students to different project groups.\n\nSuch decisions are driven by an educational objective to keep project groups diverse. A diverse project group where members come from different backgrounds help students to overcome cultural and language barriers to successfully execute tasks at hand. Such skills are sought after by employers.\nSometimes instructor randomly forms project groups due to various constraints of course logistics. For example, in an online course where students are located in different time zones."

    "section": "5.2 Team Management",
    "text": "5.2 Team Management\nThe next crucial step is team management after the group formation. Team management is all about doing the right things. It involves coordination, division of tasks, delegation, execution, and communication. In industry project, team management should follow a democratic management style where decisions are made based on general consensus. Therefore, engagement of every team member is important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubpar Performance by High Achievers\n\n\n\nIndividual student with high achievement (e.g., high GPA, straight A-graders, doing well in course assignments) may perform at subpar level due to inefficient team management in industry project.\n\n\n\n5.2.1 Choosing a team leader\nEach group should designate one of its members as a team leader. The team leader is responsible for coordinating and communicating with the client, instructor, and group. When the group schedule meetings, respond to feedback, submit project materials, and ask questions, team leader of the group should be responsible for sending the emails.\nThese added tasks do not imply that the team leader takes on an extra workload. If a team leader feels overwhelmed with these responsibilities, the group can rotate the role of team leader among them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep the Group in the Loop\n\n\n\nThe team leader must include all group members in its communication with the client and instructor.\n\nWhen sending an email to the client, all other members should be included in the CC field of the email.\nSign off your email with the group number and names of all group members.\nAlways include course name and group number in the email’s subject line.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Dividing tasks\nDeliverables (see Chapter 3) in the project is a sum total of multiple objectives that groups are expected to accomplish in the industry project. Therefore, rightly so, an industry project is a semester-long group-based activity.\nTo deliver project outcomes that meet expectations of both industry and academia, it is advised that each group divides tasks among its members according to their interests and expertise. Such division of tasks will help the group in the timely completion of project deliverables.\nWhile the process of task divisions will vary across groups, here are some of the guidelines.\nTask coordination: Team leader from the group can take on responsibility of coordinating day-to-day project related activities. For within group communication, groups can setup a chat group. For communicating with client and instructor, email is the best channel.\nProject components: The project brief document will outline expectation and scope of the business problem, which will have multiple components (e.g., industry analysis, competitor analysis, marketing mix, segmentation, advertising, channel strategy etc.). Carefully review the project brief, and decide what all needs to be accomplished in the project. Subsequently, groups can divide these tasks among themselves.\nThese are a list of project components that you may encounter during different milestones (see Chapter 2).\n\nProject Briefing\n\nUnderstanding of client, its business operation, and assigned business problems.\nPreparation of questions for industry presentation.\nFormation of group.\n\nIndustry Presentation\n\nIntroduction of group members.\nSeeking clarifications on prepared questions.\nNoting down client’s contact information and preferred method of communicating.\n\nConsultation Period\n\nMeeting with client.\nMeeting with instructor.\nDeveloping business solutions.\n\nFeedback Session\n\nPreparation of slides.\nPresentation and Q&A.\n\nExecution Period\n\nFinalizing business solutions.\nWriting report.\nMeeting with client and instructor.\n\nFinal Presentation\n\nPreparing slides.\nPresenting in the class.\n\nSubmission\n\nFinalizing report.\nSecuring individual final copies of report and slides.\nSubmitting final report and presentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild a Consensus\n\n\n\nWhile individual members could be responsible for separate project components, it is advised that the group discusses them together at some point, building a consensus. Final solutions that will be part of the final project report should arrive via group discussion, critical thinking, and agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical Thinking\n\n\n\n\nWhen you are thinking critically, you are analysing (breaking things down), evaluating (making judgements based on evidence) and synthesising or creating (putting parts together into a coherent whole).\nCritical thinking is about asking good questions, identifying bias, challenging ideas, finding credible evidence, reflecting on your own learning and transferring these skills to your professional practice.\nCritical thinking is like an onion … as you peel off one layer (begin to analyse the argument), there is another layer (more questions), and another layer (deeper questions) … and on … and on..\n\n\n\nQuantitative analysis: Business solutions that involve quantitative analyses are extensive. Quantitative analyses involve data collection, cleaning, summary, modeling, and reporting. For such tasks, it is advised to break down tasks among group members.\nGroup presentation: It is advised that all group members participate in the project presentations. However, groups can divide content preparation for the slides based on individual responsibility taken early.\nMeeting minutes: Groups are advised to maintain a record of meeting minutes. Meeting minutes should include the following items: date, participants, and discussed topics. If the meeting was conducted to decide on conflicted topics, then include motion and voting outcomes. Such a record can serve as evidence showing your progress in the project.\n\n\n5.2.3 Teamwork\nEvery team member in the group must contribute. Otherwise, team members may face individual grade penalties (see Chapter 4). Individual contribution in the project shows through the following actions.\n\nResponding to team communications.\nCompleting tasks assigned to the individual team member in a timely manner.\nAttending meetings with the team, client, and instructor.\nActive participation in the presentations.\nBeing flexible to take on extra responsibility to complete the project on time.\nTaking initiative and lead when required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual Contribution\n\n\n\nIf your project team has N members, your contribution in the project must be at least \\(1/N \\times 100\\)%.\nFor example, if your team has 5 members, the individual contribution must be at least \\(1/5 \\times 100 = 25\\)%.\n\n\nIn a real business environment, you do not get to choose your team members for a project. Therefore, while you are in an academic environment, an industry project in a course is an excellent opportunity to learn team skills that require dealing with different personalities and work styles."

    "text": "5.3 Client Management\nManaging the industry partner or client is a crucial step of project management. Industry partners are investing their time and resources in such an academia-industry collaboration. We should be thankful for clients’ engagement and remember that they have other important businesses to run. Therefore, always be nice to the client.\n\n5.3.1 Client relationship\nBuilding a good relationship with a client is important. The first rule of client management is to show respect. Clients may have a strong affinity for their brands, and they may be heavily involved in their companies personally. Therefore, avoid overly criticizing clients that may come across as insults. If you have negative comments about clients’ operation, think carefully how to put it politely, if possible, with a positive spin.\nCritically think about the client’s business problems to find opportunities. To that end, you should focus on the client’s strengths rather than overly fault-finding. Instead of commenting on what the client has not done, you should focus more on what they have done and how to improve them. Such an approach will make your interactions with the client mutually beneficial and both of you will enjoy the process.\nTo perform well and gain client’s appreciation, it is important that students are well informed of the client’s business operation and are focused on solving the assigned business problems faced by the the client. Business solutions should strive to discover new insights, creative ideas, and feasible business strategies. With a good understanding of the business constraints faced by the clients, students should come out with out-of-the-box solutions. To that end, it is advised that rather than listing actions that the client could implement, students could focus on key topic, dive deep into it, and propose strategies that will have the highest chance of improving the client’s key business operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-term Relationship\n\n\n\nDon’t think of building a client relationship for a short duration just to finish the project. You should think of it as an investment in career building by having long-term relationship with the client. Such a relationship will benefit you in future. For example,\n\nClient can provide you with glowing recommendation when you go to job market.\nClient can provide you with an employment opportunity (e.g., internship or full time position).\nClient can organize competition in a project where the winning team gets a prize.\nClient can give you invaluable entrepreneurial experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Client interview\n\nI keep six honest serving-men;\n\n\n    (They taught me all I knew)\n\nTheir names are What and Why and When\n\n\n    And How and Where and Who.\n\nBy Rudyard Kipling (1902), “The Elephant’s Child” from Just So Stories\n\nThe feasibility of your business solutions depends on your deep understanding of business problems faced by the client. And, you develop such an understanding by asking appropriate questions to your client. Even if you think questions are too simple to ask, go ahead and ask. To ensure you have understood the client’s answers, state them back to your client during the interview in your own words.\nYour client interview questions should include the following questions to seek clarity on assigned business problems.\n\nAsk them to repeat the business problem as described in the project briefing?\nWhat is the cause of the problem?\nWhat has been past strategies to address the problem?\nWhat are the constraints or limitations that the business is facing?\nWhy the business problem is critical to their business operation?\nWhen they plan to implement new business strategies?\nWhere their business is operating (e.g., local vs. global market)\nHow they would like to approach the problem (e.g, within or without constraints)?\nWho are the contact persons from the company to seek additional resources?\n\nFor your first meeting with the client, groups should perform preliminary background research on the client. You should read the project brief document and client presentation, explore client’s website and social media presence, and look into the client press coverage. The main goal of such a background research is to arrive at the interview fully prepared. You can adopt a client interview sheet as shown in Figure 5.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Client Interview Sheet\n\n\n“What is the client's business problem” is what the client needs with and your main goal to provide business solutions.\n“What is the client's business objective” is the essence of the project, and it defines client’s expectation from project deliverables.\n“What resources does the client have” gives you leverage to tackle the assigned business problems.\n“What constraints does the client face” provides you with an business environment where you are going to propose your business solutions.\nBased on answers to the above questions, you should start discussing about ideas and solutions for the client’s business problems.\nYou should always take meeting minutes and maintain such records. For your subsequent meetings, you should review the past meeting minutes to ensure you are progressing and not stuck on some particular issue. Also, groups should organize brainstorming sessions before meeting with the client or instructor."

Online chat groups (e.g., WhatsApp), emails, and collaborative tools (such as Microsoft Team, Zoom, Collaborate Ultra) help you with online communication. Whenever possible it is advised to conduct face-to-face meetings rather than virtual.\nIn the project, groups may also need to share additional resources (such as documents, data, reports, articles, and references).\n\n5.4.1 Sharing documents\nCollaborative Data Storage: Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive are some of the cloud storage providers. For free usage, these services provide sufficient storage to share documents among team members in industry project.\nCollaborative Document Management: Collaborative document management systems such as Google Docs, Canva Docs, and Microsoft 365 can be used to create and collaborate on project report and presentation in real-time.\nCollaborative Project Management: For ideation and time management, groups can use Miro and Padlet. You can record details of your brainstorming sessions using these tools.\nCollaborative Reference Management: For sharing and collaborating references, groups can use Zotero Groups. Zotero is a free citation management tool.\n\n\n5.4.2 Role of instructor\nThe course instructor is one of the valuable resources at your disposal. It would be best if you utilized the instructor’s expertise to your own advantage in executing industry projects.\nMeet with the instructor regularly. Update her about your progress, your discussion with the client, and the issues you are struggling with. The instructor has a clear understanding of the scope of the project, and she is aware of the time constraint that students face in the course. Therefore, she would be in the best position to guide you through timely project completion. She can provide you with relevant literature reference, clarify your doubts, and can talk to the client on your behalf.\nYour instructor is going to grade your project deliverables. She will also detect any cases of plagiarism."

    "text": "6.1 Parts of Report\nWorking on an industry project can be daunting. Not only do groups have to come up with creative and feasible solutions to given business problems by the client, but they also have to submit a written report. Such a report is a professional business document that systematically presents the group’s business solutions by including background research and future directions.\nEach one of us has different ways to manage the complexities of a project. However, when working in a group, we must be in sync with the other members of the project. Therefore, a formal way of managing a project that focuses on the whole group rather than a single individual is essential. We outline some of the steps that students can follow in a group that will form part of the report.\n\n6.1.1 Business objective\nGet answers to the following questions.\n\nWhat is your client’s business problem?\n\nWhich business problem of the client are you solving? Analyze it critically.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere could be multiple solutions to your client’s business problem, and you are exploring the feasibility of one or some.\n\nWhy is it important?\n\nWhat is the goal of your client (e.g., market expansion, customer experience management, new product development, advertising, market growth, sales)?\n\nWho needs to be involved?\n\nWhich entities of the organization will be involved in solving the problem (e.g., operation, marketing, accounting, human resources)?\n\nWhat enables and restricts your client?\n\nWhat are the strenghts and weaknesses of the client (e.g., SWOT analysis)? \n\nHow will the client measure success?\n\nWhat metrics or key performance indicators (KPIs) will be used to measure the success of the business solutions?\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Business environment\nGet answers to the following questions focusing on customers, competition, the external business environment, and deeper insights into the business problems.\n\nWhat are the customers’ problems?\n\nWhat kinds of customers’ needs and wants are satisfied by the client’s offerings? What are the pain points of consumption?\n\nWhat alternative solutions customers have access to?\n\nWhat alternatives are there for the client’s customers? How is the client competing for customers’ time, attention, engagement, and involvement? How does the client’s offering beat the alternatives?\n\nWho are the competitors in your business?\n\nWhich other companies or organizations are providing similar solutions in the market to target the same set of customers?\n\nWhat are the disruptive factors for the business?\n\nHow do external factors (such as competitive, regulatory, economic, social, and technological) impact the client’s business?\n\nGather news, events, start-ups, experts, and public debate relating to the business problem.\n\nGo beyond your comfort zone to understand the client’s business problems. Explore additional resources such as data, technical reports, financial statements, public debate, news articles, and expert opinions.\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Data requirement\n\nYour proposed business solutions should be data-driven. While intuition or simply knowing what is right or wrong will get you so far, it through data that you will be able to verify, understand, and quantify. Thus, data-driven decision-making will help you back your new ideas or business solutions with evidence. It will thereby make you more confident in your proposed business solutions and help reduce cost and risk.\nGet answers to the following questions that will help you in data-driven decision-making.\nWhat data do we need?\n\nData help you in uncovering hidden patterns that intuition alone can not fathom. However, you need to have clarity on what sorts of patterns you are after (e.g., consumer behavior, competition, product features) that will help you identify right kind of data.\n\nWhat are the data sources?\n\nWhere do you get access to these data? You can utilize secondary data for some business problems (e.g., market share). In contrast, for others, you may need primary data (e.g., consumers’ intention for a new product purchase that can be collected using a survey).\n\nOperationalize key metrics from the data to define business success.\n\nYou should use data to define metrics or key performance indicators that help clients quantify your business solutions’ success (or failure).\n\nWhat are the competitive advantage provided by the data?\n\nUse data to tell a compelling business story. In many business contexts, especially in service sector, data can be a valuable asset to firms that they can monetize.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation \\(\\neq\\) Causation\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may uncover patterns in data. Beware not to interpret correlation or association among variables as causal relationships unless you have modeled data using appropriate research design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Customer experience\n\nToday’s business philosophy has shifted from a product-centric to a customer-centric business model. In marketing, customer centricity refers to focusing on the right customers for strategic advantage. Such a marketing strategy generates more profits by aligning a firm’s offerings (products or services) with the wants and needs of its most valuable customers. The challenge is often in identifying the right customers or most valuable customers.\nTo address that challenge you will need to get answers to the following questions that pertain to understanding customers’ purchase journey.\nDefine customer purchase journey starting from awareness all the way to the purchase.\n\nHow do customers interact with the client? Explore these questions by looking at customers’ pre-purchase, purchase, and post-purchase behaviors.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the different ways to segment customers?\n\nNot all customers are created equal. Customers’ needs, wants, behavior, sensitivities, and responses vary among them (which is also called customer heterogeneity). Find ways to segment the client’s customers (e.g., define characteristics of each customer segment) and identify which ones are the right customers (e.g., get insights into their likes/dislikes/size/preference/choice) to align their strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Experience\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have identified different stages of the customer purchase journey (CPJ) for different segments of customers, you will use distinct marketing strategies (e.g., social media marketing, email marketing, search marketing, channel strategy) to provide a superior customer experience at every stage of CPJ to facilitate customer engagement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.5 Idea generation\nYou now understand the client’s business problem, business environment, data requirements, and customers. It is time now to generate new ideas to solve the assigned business problem. This part will be the critical part of the report showing your contribution, creativity, critical thinking, and strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Rules of Idea Creation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrial and error\nLearn from others\nMake mistakes\n\n\n\n\nBased on your prior research, you may ask the following questions to generate ideas or solutions\nWhat ideas help in reducing or eliminating customers’ pain?\n\nWhat strategies or solutions will help in eliminating customers’ pain points? For example, doe the client need to offer multiple touchpoints to engage with customers, is there a need to provide multiple channels to ease the pain of purchasing? You will use elements of marketing mix (product, price, place, and promotion) to address customers’ pain points.\n\n\n\n\nWhat ideas help in enhancing or generating customer value?\n\nHow your solutions are helping client to generate customer value by eliminating those customer pain points? How will you capture the customer value?\n\nHow your ideas help in increasing the overall company value?\n\nAlso, you should link the role of customer value in creating business value. These are some of the metrics to capture business value.\n\n\n\nSales\nProfits\nCustomer engagement\nBrand value\nPotential investor\nCompetitive advantage\nEmployee satisfaction\n\n\nHow the feasibility of your ideas are linked to the company’s budget constraints?\n\nYour client will face certain business constraints under the given business environment. You should critically evaluate the feasibility of your ideas under such conditions. It would be best if you discussed with the client whether those constraints are short or long-term before finalizing your solutions.\n\nIf you have multiple ideas, then you should profile your ideas to get an assessment of the best feasible idea.\n\nThe assessment can be based on the following:\n\n\n\nNovelty.\nImpact of idea on customer experience.\nImpact of idea on business value.\nHow easily the idea can be copied.\nWhat is the return on investing (ROI) of the idea.\nHow easy it is to implement.\nIs idea in line with the business’s vision.\nRisk involved in implementing the idea.\nCost-benefit analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfiling Concepts\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you finalize an idea, you should profile each concept (or idea). Group should perform this collectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.6 Experimenting\nThe best idea needs to be tested before its implementation at wider scale. Hence, there is need for experimenting. Following are some of the ways marketing concepts are experimented.\n\n\nFake advertising\nSurvey\nMarket research\nValidation using survey or market research\nFocus group\nPrototype\nA/B Testing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum Viable Product (MVP)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your client is a startup, you can experiment with minimum viable product (MVP). An MVP is a free-standing product with minimal features that solves the most important problem for the customers it is supposed to serve. An MVP shows validation of learning customers’ needs, wants, pain points, and preferences with the least efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.7 Impact evaluation\nSuccess of any strategy is judged by its impact. Such an impact can be measured on two level.\n\n\nImpact on Customer Value\n\n\nHow the strategy impacts customer purchase journey?\nHow the strategy impacts customer engagement?\nHow the strategy impacts customer awareness?\nHow the strategy impacts customer purchase?\nHow the strategy impacts customer loyalty?\nHow the strategy impacts customer advocacy and bonding?\nHow the strategy impacts customer repurchase?\nHow the strategy impacts customer touchpoints?\n\n\nImpact on Business Value\n\n\nHow the strategy impacts business value?\nHow the strategy impacts market share?\nHow the strategy impacts market size?\nHow the strategy impacts business growth?\nHow the strategy impacts revenue and profitability?\nHow the strategy impacts brand value or branding?\nHow the strategy impacts image of the company?\n\n\n\n\n6.1.8 Quantifying ROI\nThe success of any business strategy is sustainable if it has a long-term impact, which is measured by its effect on the firm’s bottom line.\nThe firm’s bottom line constitutes:\n\nSales or Revenue\nProfits\n\nTherefore, if you can show that your strategy has a significant impact on the firm’s bottom line, then the firm will be more willing to implement it as a long-term solution. You can show this my quantifying return on investment (ROI).\nROI, put simply, is the sum of what you get back, divided by what you put in. Thus,\n\\[\n\\text{Return on Investment (ROI)} = \\frac{\\text{Revenue}-\\text{Cost}}{\\text{Cost}} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Cost}}\n\\]\nHowever, isolating the impact of your strategy on the firm’s bottom line is often challenging. Such challenges occur as there are other changes, internal and external, taking place in the firm. Therefore, to tease out the main effect of your proposed strategy on the firm’s ROI is very important to convince the top management of the company. In this regard, you could offer metrics that will help the managers to see the impact of your strategy on the firm’s bottom line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n\n\nA good marketing ROI is a ratio of 5:1 — you’re making $5 for every $1 you spend.\nAn ROI of 2:1 is barely profitable because other business expenses reduce that ratio closer to 1:1.\nA digital marketing ROI of 10:1 is considered exceptional. You’re definitely turning a profit, even when you account for external variables.\n\nEven though 5:1 serves as a solid benchmark, a “good” ROI is somewhat subjective. It depends heavily on your industry and use case. Some industries are more saturated and take larger marketing budgets to cut through the noise. So don’t make ROI your end-all be-all metric. Instead, stick to your preset goals and key performance indicators (KPIs) — one of which might be ROI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROI Concerns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROI indicates the performance of marketing strategy against high-intent “in-market audiences” with a level of affinity towards a brand or product. In other words, those likely to buy, whether marketing strategies are implemented or not.\nGrowth from marketing strategies comes from stimulating not just sales from people in-market, but also future prospects who will make up most of the sales over time.\nROI will be difficult to capture for startups. Then, what should you do? Many advancements have been made in recent years to establish fair, transparent metrics to capture the full extent of marketing’s contribution – from “mental market share” and “effective reach” to the concept of “attention.”"

Thus, it follows a definite style (as outlined in the Chapter 6) and is succinct and precise.\n\nFor your final project report, it is advised that you follow the practical writing style.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreak the Rule\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can break away from the practical style by adopting classical style once in a while as it is direct, conversational, unfussy.\nFor example, practical style might say the sentence 'It is he' is grammatically correct, while 'It's him' is incorrect. Following the rule, you might kill the romance by saying 'Hi, Honey, it's I' or make the breakup ludicrous by saying 'It's not you, it's I'."

    "section": "8.3 Useful Tips",
    "text": "8.3 Useful Tips\nSome of the good practices for writing your report are listed below:\n\nWrite in active voice. If required then use passive voice judiciously.\n\n\nDevelop a field specific vocabulary. Note that a specific word in a specific field have a very specific meaning. They are part of technical terminologies followed in the field. You should not abuse these terminologies by using them outside their unintended contexts. Best way to familiarize yourself with these technical terms is to read the literature thoroughly.\n\n\nWhen you are describing a new idea or concept in a paragraph put it in the end. The paragraph should begin with familiar concepts on which you build upon your new idea. This helps readers in seeing the connections and makes it consistent. Use the rule Familiar first, Unfamiliar last.\n\n\nWhen you argue something using numbers carefully describe what that number means (e.g., how it is operationalized, what is the unit etc.). Don’t just throw numbers at the readers.\n\n\nBreak your long sentences into smaller ones. You should try to put just one piece of information per sentence. Don’t use very long paragraphs. However, there should be logical transition from one paragraph to another.\n\n\nOmit unnecessary words. Use simple words but be careful about the technical terms used in the field.\n\n\nSparingly use adjectives/adverbs.\n\n\nAvoid repetitions of the same thing. Be concise.\n\n\nAvoid abbreviations and acronyms.\n\n\nCross reference tables, figures, and sections by their number (and name) in the text.\n\n\nDo spell-check and proofread carefully. Make sure the paragraphs are coherent and there is consistent flow in your texts.\n\n\nDon’t use uninformative 'this' in the sentence, i.e., use of 'this' without clear antecedent. For example, \"This shows that technology is important in a digital marketing environment\". This what? This should always have something following it. For example,\"This behavioral change shows that technology is important in a digital marketing environment\".\n\n\nMaintain clarity and consistency.\n\n\nUse the normal sentence structure: subject, verb, object. Every sentence should have a subject, verb and object.\n\n\nPut actions in verbs.\n\n\nPut characters in subjects.\n\n\nKeep subjects near verbs.\n\n\nTables are part of your writing. Titles and headings in tables should be self-explanatory. Use footnotes (or notes) in tables to make their readability clear. It helps skimming readers to understand the fact presented without having to go searching through the text.\n\n\nDon’t overload your sentences.\n\n\nParagraphs should have structure and flow.\n\n\nUse colon (:) and semicolon (;) properly. The semicolon (;) means roughly “furthermore” (or a parallel remark). The colon (:) means roughly “to be specific” (or an illustration to follow).\n\n\nDon’t use commas (,), which aren’t necessary.\n\n\nRewrite (or revisit) every sentence you have written. For clarity, rearrange words, phrases, and paragraphs. Rewriting will help removing clutter.\n\n\nDon’t succumb to the temptation of using business jargon.\n\n\nDon’t start a sentence with a mathematical symbol.\n\n\nDon’t say “which” when “that” sounds better. The general rule nowadays is to use “which” only when it is preceded by a comma or by a preposition, or when it is used interrogatively.\n\n\nUse the correct number of significant digits, not whatever the program spits out. For example, stick with two or three significant digits.\n\n\nGood and relevant figures make your report alive. They communicate the pattern in data visually, which is better than numbers in tables.\n\n\nUse “we” instead of “I” in the report as it is an outcome of a group effort.\n\n\nDon’t misuse hyphens (-). Hyphens are used for true compound modifiers before the noun (e.g., after-tax income, risk-free rate, two-day return). When there is no risk of misinterpretation, the hyphen can be omitted, but the treatment must be consistent throughout the paper.\n\n\n“Where” refers to a place. “In which” refers to a model. Don’t write “models where consumers have uninsured shocks,” write “models in which consumers have uninsured shocks.”\n\n\nDon’t overuse italics. It’s best to use them only when the emphasis in a sentence would otherwise not be clear."

Don’t change the font size to fit the text.\n\n\nMinimize text: the fewer bullets and the fewer words per slide the better. No full sentences on slides. The slides should support your talk, not replace it.\n\n\nTitle: Use informative titles for your slides. Ideally, your main message should be decipherable by simply reading the titles of your slides in succession.\n\n\nNever use math symbols that have not been introduced.\n\n\nSimplicity: Better to make one point well on a slide than to overwhelm an audience with text.\n\n\nRoadmap: Use a roadmap if you would like to outline your presentation. It can also be helpful to revisit during the presentation to tell the audience where you are in the talk.\n\n\nColor: The traditional red-blue colors are bad for those who are color blind.\n\n\nSlide Tone: If possible, play a subtle sound when slide is advanced to the next slide. This enables audience to hear an auditory signal (from a low C to a high C note) of their progress through the slides, which helps blind people follow the presentation.\n\n\nBackground Color: For presentations in large auditoriums, go black background with white text.\n\n\nGraphs: Be consistent in using fonts for graphs. It is advised to keep graphs in central location on slides.\n\n\nAnimations: Avoid too many animations in your presentations."

Don’t present in shorts, t-shirts, and thongs.\n\n\nMake a conscious decision on which sections need more talking and which can be skimmed.\n\n\nThere is no penalty for finishing early.\n\n\nThe easiest way to prepare a presentation is to imagine you are having a dinner table discussion with your family on the topic. The goal of your presentation is to ensure your family members understand you by the time dinner is over.\n\n\nTransitions are key. Tell the audience where you are going. Say when one subject is done and you are moving to the next subject. Say things like: “I have described the business problems. Now we are going to …” Use back references. For example, say “I told you that social media marketing is going to be crucial for the client to connect with its customers. The way I plan to implement the client’s social media marketing is …”\n\n\nMention the limitations of your report.\n\n\nYou won’t be able to avoid a situation where somebody asks you a question disagreeing with your solutions. In answering questions of this type, use the principle “first the bad news, then the good news.” You first admit that your solutions have limitations. Do this without hesitation, because your audience needs to understand that you are a reasonable person and are aware of where your solutions fail. So, say something like: “yes, I agree with you that these limitations may not help realizing the target ROI for the client.” After you are on the same page with the audience, you can now say something positive about your solution, like “But I still think that given the business environment that the client is facing, social media marketing will provide optimal returns in comparision to other touchpoints.”"

    "text": "10.2 Consumer Behavior\nConsumer behavior refers to the study of how consumers make decisions relating to the following contexts:\n\nto satisfy their needs, wants, and desires\nto make choice\nto have preference\nto purchase/buy\nto use and dispose products\n\nIn Figure 10.2, a simplified framework of consumers’ decision making process is illustrated.\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2: Consumer Decision Making Processs\n\n\nOne of the oldest model to understand sales strategy based on consumer behavior was developed in 1898 by Elmo Lewis, an advertising strategist, called AIDA. It stands for awareness, interest, desire, and action. AIDA model has been used to define marketing funnel to understand customers’ buying stages as shown in Figure 10.3.\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Marketing Funnel based on AIDA Model\n\n\nConsumer behavior has become increasingly complex with the increasing impact of digital technologies in the marketplace. Hence, especially in a digital marketing environment, marketers are interested in the consumer purchase journey that captures a process that consumers go through, across all stages and touchpoints that make up the consumer experience. Consumer experience is a multidimensional construct that involves cognitive, emotional, behavioral, sensorial, and social components. Accordingly, marketers instead of marketing funnel use consumer purchase map to understand consumer purchase journey to enhance consumer experience at each and every stage via multiple touchpoints. A consumer purchase map consists of details of decision paths and key interactions customers encounter with a brand as they move through the complex purchase process. Figure 10.4 shows customer journey map for Ikea. A well crafted customer journey map provides a gateway into customers’ minds, helping brands to understand and address customers’ pain points thereby providing them with superior customer experience.\n\n\n\nFigure 10.4: Customer Journey Map for Ikea\n\n\nCustomer heterogeneity is an important concept in consumer behavior. It means all customers differ. Customer heterogeneity captures the variation among customers in terms of their needs, wants, responses, and behaviors. marketers use individual differences, life experiences, functional needs, self-identity, and marketing activities to explain customer heterogeneity. The core objective of a quintessential marketing strategy of segmentation, positioning and targeting (STP) is to address customer heterogeneity. Figure 10.5 illustrates this concept.\n\n\n\nFigure 10.5: Customer Segments due to Heterogeneity"

    "text": "10.3 Relationship Marketing\n\n\n\nFigure 10.6: Marketing Eras\n\n\nFigure 10.6 shows the evolution of marketing. The focus of current marketing strategies is on customers and building relationship with them. In 2004, American Marketing Association followed the following definition of marketing that emphasized on relationship building.\n\nMarketing is an organizational function and a set of processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing customer relationships in ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholders.\n\nFirms create value by focusing their strategies on two dimensions: transactional and relational. Long-lasting firm value is an outcome of relational marketing.\nRelationship marketing is the process of identifying, developing, maintaining, and terminating relational exchanges with the purpose of enhancing performance.\nThe objective of relationship marketing is to optimize customer lifetime value (LTV) rather than per customer transaction. Customer LTV can be captured either using past customer value or future customer value.\nFor a customer \\(i\\), if we know her gross contribution margin, \\(GC\\), for all the past time periods, \\(t = \\{1,...,T\\}\\), then the past customer value, \\(PTV\\) is:\n\\[\nPTV = \\sum_{t=1}^{T}GC_{it} \\times (1+r)^t,\n\\] where \\(r\\) is the interest rate.\nHowever, firms are often interested in the future value of their customers. Note that the value that will be received in future is discounted at current time period due to uncertainty and consumer psychology. Let’s assume \\(\\delta\\) is the discount rate. Therefore, for a customer \\(i\\), if we assume her future gross contribution margin, \\(GC\\), for all the future time periods, \\(t = \\{1,...,T\\}\\), then the future customer value or simply the customer life time value, \\(LTV\\) is:\n\\[\nLTV = \\sum_{t=1}^{T}GC_{it} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\delta}\\right)^t\n\\] Next, note that firms are not sure about the future contributions from consumers. It depends on what is the retention rate, \\(Rr\\). Let’s assume that retention rate remains constant over time. Then, factoring in this information, the life time value becomes:\n\\[\nLTV = \\sum_{t=1}^{T}GC_{it} \\times \\left(\\frac{Rr}{1+\\delta}\\right)^t\n\\]\nLet’s assume \\(CAC\\) is the customer acquisition cost.5 Factoring in this information, the life time value becomes:\n\\[\nLTV = \\left(\\sum_{t=1}^{T}GC_{it} \\times \\left(\\frac{Rr}{1+\\delta}\\right)^t\\right) - CAC\n\\] If contribution margin is constant over time, i.e., \\(GC_{it} = GC_{i} \\text{  } \\forall \\text{ } t\\in\\{1,...,T\\}\\) then we can simplify the above equation over the infinite time horizon, i.e., \\(T=\\infty\\).\nLet’s assume the first term is denoted by \\(S\\) such that:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{split}\n    S &= \\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty}{GC_{i} \\left(\\frac{Rr}{1+\\delta}\\right)^t}\\\\\n      &= \\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty}{GC_{i} (a)^t}\\\\\n    \\end{split}\n    \\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n    a=\\frac{Rr}{1+\\delta}\n    \\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nNow expanding the sum \\(S\\) we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n    S=GC_{i}(a)^1+GC_{i}(a)^2+GC_{i}(a)^3+....\\infty\n    \\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nMultiplying both sides of this equation with \\(a\\) we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n    aS=GC_{i}(a)^2+GC_{i}(a)^3+GC_{i}(a)^4+....\\infty\n    \\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nSubtracting \\(aS\\) from \\(S\\) we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{split}\n    S-aS= & GC_{i}(a)^1+GC_{i}(a)^2+GC_{i}(a)^3+....\\infty\\\\\n          & \\qquad \\qquad -GC_{i}(a)^2-GC_{i}(a)^3-....\\infty\\\n    \\end{split}\n    \\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nThus we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n    S-aS= GC_{i}(a)\n    \\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nWe get sum \\(S\\) as:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n    S= \\frac{GC_{i}(a)}{1-a}\n    \\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nThe term \\(1-a\\) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{split}\n    1-a &= 1-\\frac{Rr}{1+\\delta}\\\\\n        &= \\frac{1+\\delta-Rr}{1+\\delta}\n    \\end{split}\n    \\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(a\\) and \\(1-a\\) in \\(S\\) we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{split}\n    S &= \\frac{GC_{i}(a)}{1-a}\\\\\n      &= GC_{i} \\times \\frac{Rr}{1+\\delta} \\times \\frac{1+\\delta}{1+\\delta-Rr}\\\\\n      &= GC_{i}\\left(\\frac{Rr}{1+\\delta-Rr}\\right)\n    \\end{split}\n    \\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nThus, the life time value \\(LTV_{i}\\) of customer \\(i\\) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n    LTV_{i}=GC_{i}\\left(\\frac{Rr}{1+\\delta-Rr}\\right) - CAC\n    \\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nThus we see that CLV is simply the consumer \\(i\\)’s gross margin, \\(GC_{i}\\) times a margin multiplier \\(\\left(\\frac{Rr}{1+\\delta-Rr}\\right)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\frac{LTV}{CAC}\\) Ratio\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestors are often interested in LTV/CAC ratio to evaluate early-stage companies or startups. The ratio tells how much a company receives from a customer for every $1 spent to acquire her.\n\n\\(\\frac{LTV}{CAC} \\sim 3.0 \\times\\): Ideal target range. Considered as reasonably profitable. You are generating three times the value of acquisition from each new customer.\n\\(\\frac{LTV}{CAC} < 1.0 \\times\\): Considered as unsustainable, cash burner, unable to monetize. It costs as much to acquire new customers as they spend on your product. It is time to refine your sales, acquisition, and pricing strategies.\n\\(\\frac{LTV}{CAC} > 5.0 \\times\\): Red flags. Investors may think the company has missed some growth opportunities. Each customer to the company is worth more than the onboarding costs. The company can afford to allocate more resources to marketing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayback Period on CAC\n\n\n\n\n\nThis metric takes into account the time a company needs to pay back the cost of acquiring a customer.\n\nAverage startup has payback period of 15 months based on gross margin.\n\nShorter payback time indicate growth potential in startups as less working capital is needed for marketing.\nFor startups, this is a good metric as it is hard to figure out the LTV of customers due to product changes and variations in customer adoption."

    "text": "10.4 Customer Centricity\nMarketing strategies have evolved from being product-centric to customer-centric. Customer centricity is about understanding how not all customers are created equal, and aligning marketing resources to meet the needs and wants of most profitable segments. It is about value-addition rather than value-extraction.\n\nThe opportunities to use customer analysis to change behavior go way, way beyond what is in the marketing domain — it goes to how we think about profitability, how we align channels, how we align the service propositions, how we align the operational experience, and how we understand which elements of products or categories are good for acquiring and retaining customers.\n\nThe difference between product centric and customer centric business models are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocus\nProduct Centric\nCustomer Centric\n\n\n\n\nStrategy\nBetter product\nBetter customer solutions\n\n\nCulture\nProduct & sales\nNew solutions for customer needs\n\n\nProcess\nNPD6\nFacilitating new customer experience\n\n\nValue\nSales & profitability\nLong-lasting customer relationship & CLV\n\n\n\nCustomer centricity is based on the notion that the best customers, the ones you should focus on, is the ones with the highest customer lifetime value. Thus, the focus is on value per acquisition instead of cost per acquisition.\n\nFor most companies, it is a gross error to develop a marketing program aimed at the “average customer.” Today such a consumer, or such a company, hardly exists. In short, the company that is not alert to the customers’ needs and the changing complexities of marketplaces is inviting disaster."

Therefore, despite firms not having control over them, external factors comprising of competitive, regulatory, economic, social, and technological affect consumer behavior and firm performance. Marketing is the external eye of a firm that constantly scans the external business environment for identifying and explaining trends (see Figure 10.7).\n\n\n\nFigure 10.7: Environmental Forces\n\n\nFollowing are some of the tools to scan the external environmental forces (see Figure 10.11).\n\n10.5.1 SWOT analysis\nYou can use swot analysis to assess advantages and disadvantages faced by the client (see Figure 10.8).\n\n\n\nFigure 10.8: SWOT Analysis\n\n\n\n\n10.5.2 Growth strategy\nBCG matrix can be used to analyze the business portfolio of your client (see Figure 10.9).\n\n\n\nFigure 10.9: Business Portfolio Analysis\n\n\nYou can also use hedgehog (fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing) and blue ocean (can we go outside and swim in the blue ocean) analyses to examine business expansion strategy (see Figure 10.10).\n\n\n\nFigure 10.10: Business Portfolio Analysis\n\n\nMarketers can also create value and grow from nothing by deeply understanding consumer behavior. Such a strategy is called black hole strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Hole Strategy\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack hole strategy is about finding hidden opportunities to change behavioral patterns of people who are used to doing things in a particular way or not doing them at all.\nExample: According to the latest Stack Overflow research, a large percentage of developers learned to code on their own, and only about 40% cited online courses as the learning method. What will be the most prominent educational platform? The one that will stop selling online courses and make a platform that helps self-education.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.5.3 Porter’s five forces\nPorters five forces could be used to understand the competitive landscape faced by the client.\n\n\n\nFigure 10.11: Competitive Forces\n\n\nAt the heart of any marketing models dealing with competitive analysis lies the ratio \\(\\frac{(focal)}{(focal+others)}\\), which captures the effects of \\(focal\\) variables on market performance (e.g., market share, purchase probability). The ratio is a formulation of bringing competitive effects into the model by simple normalization.\n\n\n10.5.4 Mystery shopping\nMystery shopping is an investigative marketing technique to assess the quality of customer experience at competitors’ locations by visiting. It is the most basic form of market research.\nMystery shopping is a useful market research tool in service sector (e.g., banks, restaurants, shops, travel agencies, airlines, car dealer)."

    "text": "10.6 Digital Marketing\nDigital marketing explores the changing nature of traditional areas of marketing (such as product, pricing, promotion, and place) due to major impact of digital technologies (internet, digital computing tools, hardware, software), online networks (social media for communication and connection, digital platforms for distribution), information (information goods, quality of signal), and attention (plethora of information cause scarcity of attention).\nHow digital technologies have changed marketing landscape?\n\nLowered search costs for customers.\nLowered marginal cost of digital goods (anything that can be represented as bits and bytes are called digital goods), i.e., certain digital goods can be replicated at no costs.\nLowered transportation cost of digital goods.\nLead to the proliferation of individual-level data, enabling the marketer to do personalization and targeting at a much more granular level.\nLowered cost of firms’ reputation.\nEnabled proliferation of social networks at a massive scale.\nLead to explosion of information.\nCreated scarcity of attention.\n\nThese major impacts of digital technologies have changed marketing fundamentally. These impacts are felt at both sides: firm and consumers. Digital technologies have empowered customers. Therefore, for brands to succeed in digital marketing environment, it is essential for them to drive brand-related conversations in consumer-space rather than in brand-space. Furthermore, brands need to constantly improve and refine their digital marketing strategies to build affect both transactional and relational dimensions of the customer-firm relationship.\nIn today’s technology driven marketplace, a strong digital marketing strategy could become a question of survival for many firms. In industry projects, you may be dealing with the following types of clients’ digital marketing strategy: social media marketing, multichannel marketing, search engine marketing, search engine optimization, email marketing, online advertising, content marketing, website marketing, mobile marketing, marketing platforms, online brand community."

In marketing, decisions relating to customer relationship management, personalization, marketing mix, automation, optimization, and customer privacy are driven by data. Such an approach to data-driven marketing provides companies with a competitive advantage and improved financial performance.

That’s when you realize the importance of marketing analytics. Market research will provide you with metrics that primarily serve as lagging indicators, whereas metrics coming from marketing analytics are often leading indicators.\n\nMarketing analytics involves collection, management, and analysis — descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive and cognitive — of data to obtain insights into marketing performance, maximize the effectiveness of instruments of marketing control, and optimize firms’ return on investment (ROI).\n\nMarketing analytics helps in capturing all the relevant market data to be integrated, analyzed, and interpreted to evaluate all options for growth. It helps in modeling and capturing interdependence in marketing mix (product, price, place, and promotion), enabling firms to consider multiple options and their associated risks. To that end, marketing analytics helps firm in achieving three goals: attribution (the process of quantifying the contribution of each element of marketing mix), optimization (run business scenarios using predictive modeling to assess efficacy of different marketing mix strategies), and allocation (real-time redistribution of limited resources across marketing activities based on optimization).\nThus, marketing analytics leads to action and tells you the reason why, ultimately helping firms to grow revenue, charge higher prices, and win against the competition."

    "section": "10.8 Strategies for Startups",
    "text": "10.8 Strategies for Startups\nSometimes you may work with startups as a part of your industry project. Strategies for startups will be bit different that established firms. Here we describe some important concepts to understand and quantify the success of startups.\n\n10.8.1 Unit Economics\nFor startups, the question of profitability is a difficult one to answer. Therefore, to simplify the complexity of measuring profitability, the focus should be on unit economics.\n\nUnit economics is measuring profit on a per unit basis. The unit will be customer.\n\nBy linking the direct revenues and costs to per unit (per customer), you’ll be able to answer one critical question: can you make more profit from a customer than the total cost of acquiring them? If the answer is no, startup may not survive.\n\n\n10.8.2 Blitzscaling\nBlitzscaling is aggressive business strategy when you need to grow very quickly. The level of risk in blitzscaling far exceeds the risk taken by a company going through normal and rational process of scaling up.\n\nIt’s the science and art of rapidly building out a company to serve a large and usually global market, with the goal of becoming the first mover at scale.\n\nIt is based on the idea of military tactics of blitzkrieg. Before blitzkrieg emerged as a military tactic, armies didn’t advance beyond their supply lines, which limited their speed. The theory of the blitzkrieg was that if you carried only what you absolutely needed, you could move very, very fast, surprise your enemies, and win. Once you got halfway to your destination, you had to decide whether to turn back or to abandon the lines and go on. Once you made the decision to move forward, you were all in. You won big or lost big.\nBlitzscaling involves both offensive and defensive marketing strategies. For online businesses, where margins are low, volume matters. Therefore, they employ all sorts of marketing strategies to scale it up quickly. Businesses can scale along three dimensions.\n\nGrow revenue\nGrow customer base\nGrow organization\n\nStrategies for blitzscaling requires freedom from normal business rules. Figure 10.13 show the growth in Facebook as a results of bltizscaling.\n\n\n\nFigure 10.13: Blitzscaling at Facebook\n\n\n\n\n10.8.3 Minimum viable product\nA primary reason of startup failure is \"no market need.\" To avoid such a trap, startups often comes up with a minimum viable product (MVP), which is a proof of concept of their ideas.\n\nAn MVP is the version of a new product that allows the team to gather the maximum amount of proven customer knowledge with the least amount of effort.\n\nHowever, MVP doesn’t have to be a product. You could consider it as a repeated process to identify the riskiest assumption, find the smallest possible experiment to test that assumption, and use the result of the experiment to improve the idea. Entrepreneurs often make the following risky assumptions.\n\nWhat consumers are looking for\nHow the design should work\nWhat marketing strategy to use\nWhat architecture will work most efficiently\nWhich monetization strategy will make it sustainable\nWhich laws and regulations have to complied with\n\nMVP allows startups to test these assumptions by putting their products in front of real users as quickly as possible."

    "text": "13.1 Types of Misconduct\nFollowing are the common types of academic misconduct that you should avoid in project deliverables.\n\n13.1.1 Plagiarism\nWhat is it:\n\nPresent someone else’s work or ideas as your own.\n\nHow to avoid:\n\nIf you are using information from external sources (e.g., academic articles, business sources, websites), then reference them properly.\nDo not use unauthorized data in your work.\n\n\n\n13.1.2 Collusion\nWhat is it:\n\nUnauthorized collaboration in preparation or presentation of work.\n\n\nDuring mid-semester presentations, students often complain about other groups stealing their ideas. The instructor will know if you steal other groups’ ideas in your deliverables.\n\nHow to avoid:\n\nDon’t steal other groups’ ideas.\nDon’t copy other groups’ work (e.g, design, layout, examples.)\nIf same materials (e.g., data, report, statements) are used across groups, make sure your data story-telling is distinct irrespective of similar analyses.\n\n\n\n13.1.3 Contract cheating\nWhat is it:\n\nContract cheating is the use of outsourced material for the purpose of submission by a student for assessment.\n\nHow to avoid:\n\nDon’t do it.\nYou use technologies (such as ChatGPT, Bard, or any other AI based writing tools) to supplement your learning. However, avoid submitting direct output from them as if it is your own work. Instructors have access to tools that differentiate AI generated text from human generated writing."

    "text": "13.2 Penalty\nPenalties for academic misconduct are severe. The immediate repercussion is a zero grade on the course project. Failing the course project may lead to failing the course as the course project will have substantial weight toward the overall course grade.\nDepending on the severity of the academic misconduct, the course instructor may report it to the university. The university may expel you from the degree program you are enrolled in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Penalty\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case of academic misconduct, the immediate penalty applies to the entire group, i.e., all members from that group receive zero grades on the course project."
